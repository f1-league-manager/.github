    <h3>The number one service to manage your F1 league racing</h3>
</div>

## ❤️ Mission

F1 League Manager is a service that makes it possible for league owners to manager their league with ease. Because of our groundbreaking tools we help people have fun with sim-racing. Our mission is to contribute to sim-racing and stimulate the growth of league racing.

## 🏗️ Applications

### Discord bot

The discord bot contains the most functionality. It’s not only a Discord bot but also provides an API to communicate with the Discord bot and with the service itself. The bot acts as the middle man between the drivers and the league. No user interface exists for the drivers so the users and drivers will do everything via the bot. The bot provides functionality for sign ups, seeing statistics and managing an account. The bot also is responsible for validating if users are driving in the upcoming event or not.

### Dashboard

Admins and league owners will communicate with the service via our custom build admin dashboard. The dashboard contains functionalities that are vital to have when operating a racing league. Functionalities include managing seasons, managing events, seeing upcoming events, managing settings and seeing audit logs.

### Session recorder
